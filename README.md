# This is SharpNote. 
## It's pretty sharp. 
This program is a small single-page web app that is based on just the native capabilties of Node.js and javascript. The app allows a user to open a chord pro formatted (chords and lyrics) text files hosted on a node.js server and then within their browser drag the words and chord symbols around. They can also transpose the chords up or down to a different musical keys.

## What technologies did I use to build SharpNote?

- Version: node v10.9.0 and OS v10.13.6
- Launch: node server.js
- Testing: http://localhost:3000/assignment2.html

### Bugs:
- Whole canvas has to be in view in order to move words around correctly.
